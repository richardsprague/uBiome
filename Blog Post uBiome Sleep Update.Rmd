In a post last month about how I use uBiome to [hack my sleep](http://www.ubiomeblog.com/hacking-sleep/), I mentioned the noticable effect potato starch has on *Bifidobacterium*, a common gut bacteria with a well-documented role in the production of many important body hormones, including some that affect sleep.

Although it seemed to greatly help my sleep, I was a bit worried about continuing my experiment because my uBiome results clearly indicated that, perhaps as a side effect of the increased *bifido*, some other microbes appeared to disappear from my gut. My solution? Test myself again, then go off potato starch until I see the results. I said I'd report back, so here's my update.

First let me notice that uBiome test results seem to come much more quickly than in the past. What took several months earlier last year now took only a few weeks. I think this is because uBiome brought some their own shiny new equipment in-house. Because of the faster turnaround, it's much more feasible to do tests like this regularly: test yourself, try something for a few weeks, then test again.
