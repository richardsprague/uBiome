How much does travel affect your microbiome? In a famous experiment [published in 2014](http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/7/R89), Duke University scientist Lawrence David tracked the daily microbiomes of two people for an entire year and [found significant differences](http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/07/microbes-over-time.html) when one of the people travelled outside the U.S. Would the same thing happen to me?

According to my latest uBiome results, the answer is yes. I recently travelled from my home in Seattle to Central America to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We spent most of our time in a rural, jungle part of Belize, about a half hour's drive from Benque, near the border with Guatemala. Besides viewing the fantastic, well-preserved Mayan ruins, we also did horseback riding, cave exploration, and of course plenty of eating.

Here's a selfie I took in front of the incredibly well-preserved thousand-year-old pyramid at [Tikal](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/secrets-of-the-maya-deciphering-tikal-2289808/):

I submitted one uBiome gut kit test just before leaving on our trip, and another immediately after returning home.  Since I've been testing myself regularly with uBiome for the past year, I have a good idea of what [my "normal" gut biome](http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/10/whats-in-my-microbiome.html) looks like. Here's the overall picture through time, including results from my [sleep hacking experiments](http://www.ubiomeblog.com/my-ubiome-sleep-hacking-update/) between October and January, which resulted in those big chunks of Actinobacteria, colored brown in the graph, now mostly gone:

Now let's look more closely at the latest sample, the one taken right after returning from the jungle:

The first thing to note is the big increase in the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes -- a change which is often [associated with obesity](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/full/4441022a.html). Interestingly, I *did* gain a couple of pounds during the trip, maybe from all that tasty coconut rice.

Otherwise my uBiome results point in a few more interesting directions:

* **Diversity**:  Oddly, my gut biome diversity went *down* slightly. Before the trip, uBiome found 19 unique phyla.  Afterwards, there were only 15. You wouldn't normally expect diversity to *drop* after exposure to novel microbes from the jungle. But I think there's an easy explanation:
* **Increase in unidentified organisms**: uBiome was able to identify only about 91% of what it found at the phyla level. In my previous tests, they found closer to 95+%.  Maybe my apparent drop in diversity was simply a drop in *identifiable* bacteria.
* **Pathogen plunge**: Counts of my "bad" bacteria, including members of the notorius *Clostridum* genus, which includes many nasty species (e.g. the infamous antibiotic-resistant *C. Difficile*) disappeared, dropping from 0.66% to 0.18%.
* **Bifido back to normal**.  The *bifidobacterium* that increased 10X when I started taking potato starch hoping to improve sleep, went back down to normal levels.  My sleep quality, by the way, hasn't changed.
* ***Akkermansia*** is gone. Usually considered a "good" bacterium, my levels had been dropping since last Summer, and now finally disappeared completely. Hopefully this is just temporary.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("../Data")
source("../sources/ubiomeCompare.R")
jan<-read.csv("sprague-ubiomejan2015x.csv")

feb<-read.csv("sprague-ubiomeFeb2015.csv")
# compare my trip to Belize
# positive numbers mean more because i went to Belize
janFeb<-uBiome_compare_samples(jan,feb)
janFebGenus<-uBiome_compare_samples(jan,feb,"genus")
#write.csv(janFebGenus,"belizeTripGenus.csv")

newAfterBelizeGenus<-uBiome_sample_unique(feb,jan,"genus")  # found in feb, but not jan
extinctAfterBelize<-uBiome_sample_unique(jan,feb,"genus")

```

Using my [free public uBiome analysis tools](https://github.com/richardsprague/uBiome), I see that I picked up the following genuses while in the jungle:

```{r}

head(newAfterBelizeGenus)
```

and a few that went extinct:
```{r}
head(extinctAfterBelize)
```

What do these bacteria do? As always, who knows? The science is so new that when I look up most of these genuses online and elsewhere, I find almost nothing relevant. All the more reason I hope you'll submit a sample to uBiome the next time *you* travel in the jungle, so we can compare and learn together.
