How much does travel affect your microbiome? In a famous experiment [published in 2014](http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/7/R89), Duke University scientist Lawrence David tracked the daily microbiomes of two people for an entire year and [found significant differences](http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/07/microbes-over-time.html) when one of the people travelled outside the U.S. Would the same thing happen to me?

According to my latest uBiome results, the answer is yes. I recently travelled from my home in Seattle to Central America to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We spent most of our time in a rural, jungle part of Belize, about a half hour's drive from Benque, near the border with Guatemala. Besides viewing the fantastic, well-preserved Mayan ruins, we also did horseback riding, cave exploration, and of course plenty of eating.

Here's a selfie I took in front of the incredibly well-preserved thousand-year-old pyramid at Tikal:

I submitted one uBiome gut kit test just before leaving on my trip, and another one immediately after returning home.  Since I've been testing myself regularly with uBiome for the past year, I have a good idea of what [my "normal" gut biome](http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/10/whats-in-my-microbiome.html) looks like. Here's my gut after ten days in a Central American jungle:

#Overall Conclusions

* **Diversity**:  Oddly, my gut biome diversity went *down* slightly. Before the trip, uBiome found 19 unique phyla.  Afterwards, there were only 15.
* **Increase in unidentified organisms**: uBiome was able to identify only about 91% of what it found at the phyla level. In my previous tests, they found closer to 95+%.  Maybe my apparent drop in diversity was simply a drop in *identifiable* bacteria.
* **Pathogen plunge**: Counts of my "bad" bacteria, including members of the notorius *Clostridum* genus, which includes many nasty species (e.g. the infamous antibiotic-resistant *C. Difficile*) disappeared, dropping from 0.66% to 0.18%.
* **Bifido back to normal**.  The *bifidobacterium* that increased 10X when I started taking potato starch hoping to improve sleep, went back down to normal levels.
* ***Akkermansia*** is gone. Usually considered a "good" bacterium, my levels had been dropping since last Summer, and now finally disappeared completely. Hopefully this is just temporary.
