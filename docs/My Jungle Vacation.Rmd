How much does travel affect your microbiome? In a famous experiment [published in 2014](http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/7/R89), Duke University scientist Lawrence David tracked the daily microbiomes of two people for an entire year and [found significant differences](http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/07/microbes-over-time.html) when one of the people travelled outside the U.S. Would the same thing happen to me?

According to my latest uBiome results, the answer is yes. I recently travelled from my home in Seattle to Central America to celebrate my wife's birthday.  We spent most of our time in a rural, jungle part of Belize, about a half hour's drive from [Benque](http://www.martzfarm.com/), near the border with Guatemala. Besides viewing the fantastic, well-preserved Mayan ruins in the area, we also did horseback riding, cave exploration, and of course plenty of eating.

Here's a selfie I took in front of the incredibly well-preserved thousand-year-old pyramid at [Tikal](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/secrets-of-the-maya-deciphering-tikal-2289808/):

What did the jungle do to my gut?  Here's the uBiome summary of the test I submitted immediately after returning home:

The first thing you might notice is the abundance of firmicutes compared to "average", a difference which is often [associated with obesity](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v444/n7122/full/4441022a.html). If this had been my only uBiome test, you might think I should have passed on the birthday cake (especially since 23andme also thinks [I'm at risk](http://blog.richardsprague.com/2008/10/whats-in-my-genes-results-from-23andme.html) for obesity). 

Interestingly, I *did* gain a couple of pounds during the trip, maybe from all that tasty [coconut rice and beans](http://www.belize.com/top-ten-things-to-taste-in-belize).

But a single result can't tell you much. Since I've been testing myself regularly with uBiome for the past year, I have a good idea of what [my "normal" gut biome](http://blog.richardsprague.com/2014/10/whats-in-my-microbiome.html) looks like. Here's the overall picture through time, including results from my [sleep hacking experiments](http://www.ubiomeblog.com/my-ubiome-sleep-hacking-update/) between October and January (see those big chunks of Actinobacteria, colored brown in the graph?):

From my previous uBiome results, you can see that my firmicutes levels bounce up and down, but not dramatically, and the jungle doesn't appear to have changed the major numbers all that much. Incidentally, I soon lost all the extra pounds after returning home to my normal diet.

Seen through time, it's clear that the most unusual change during my trip was the increase in proteobacteria, from less than 1% to almost 8%.  Even more interesting was that the Lawrence David study found the same thing: a westerner traveling to a developing country sees a sharp rise in proteobacteria!

Otherwise my uBiome results point in a few more interesting directions:

* **Diversity**:  Oddly, my gut biome diversity went *down* slightly. Before the trip, uBiome found 19 unique phyla.  Afterwards, there were only 15. You wouldn't normally expect diversity to *drop* after exposure to novel microbes from the jungle. But I think there's an easy explanation:
* **Increase in unidentified organisms**: uBiome was able to identify only about 91% of what it found at the phyla level. In my previous tests, they found closer to 95+%.  Maybe my apparent drop in diversity was simply a drop in *identifiable* bacteria.
* **Pathogen plunge**: Counts of my "bad" bacteria, including members of the notorius *Clostridum* genus, which includes many nasty species (e.g. the infamous antibiotic-resistant *C. Difficile*) disappeared, dropping from 0.66% to 0.18%.
* **Bifido back to normal**.  The *bifidobacterium* that increased 10X when I started taking potato starch hoping to improve sleep, went back down to normal levels.  My sleep quality, by the way, hasn't changed.
* ***Akkermansia*** is gone. Usually considered a "good" bacterium, my levels had been dropping since last Summer, and now finally disappeared completely. Hopefully this is just temporary.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
setwd("../Data")
source("../sources/ubiomeCompare.R")
jan<-read.csv("sprague-ubiomejan2015x.csv")

feb<-read.csv("sprague-ubiomeFeb2015.csv")
# compare my trip to Belize
# positive numbers mean more because i went to Belize
janFeb<-uBiome_compare_samples(jan,feb)
janFebGenus<-uBiome_compare_samples(jan,feb,"genus")
#write.csv(janFebGenus,"belizeTripGenus.csv")

newAfterBelizeGenus<-uBiome_sample_unique(feb,jan,"genus")  # found in feb, but not jan
extinctAfterBelize<-uBiome_sample_unique(jan,feb,"genus")

```

Using my [free public uBiome analysis tools](https://github.com/richardsprague/uBiome), I see that I picked up the following genuses while in the jungle:

```{r}

head(newAfterBelizeGenus)
```

and a few that went extinct:
```{r}
head(extinctAfterBelize)
```

What do these bacteria do? As always, who knows? The science is so new that when I look up most of these genuses online and elsewhere, I find almost nothing relevant. All the more reason I hope you'll submit a sample to uBiome the next time *you* travel in the jungle, so we can compare and learn together.
