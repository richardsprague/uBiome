<p class="p7">This book is for curious people with little or no knowledge of biology, but who have a reasonable level of comfort with computer software, either as programmer, or as an end-user comfortable with the basics of installing and running common applications (Excel).</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">The book is divided into four main sections:</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">1. The Science: an introduction to the field of the microbiome. What makes it so interesting? How do scientists go about studying it? How much is known today and what is likely to be discovered in the future?</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">2. Technology. What are the instruments and tools available to study the human microbiome?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">3. How to analyze your own microbiome: we'll walk step-by-step through the process of getting and then analyzing data about your own microbiome. Starting with easy-to-understand web tools, we'll walk you through the basics, then show you how to do simple analysis in Excel. For more complicated analysis, we'll introduce simple (free) programming tools and show step-by-step how to use them to study your own microbiome as well as compare it to others.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">4. Organisms to watch: Once you've begun the process of studying your own microbes, you'll want to know about some of the common ones and what they do. We'll walk through the basics and show you how to design experiments that let you watch the progress over time.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">5. Next steps. The information in this book will introduce you to the basics, but once you see how fascinating the microbiome can be, no doubt you'll want to go further. We'll show you how to begin growing your own favorite microbes, and then give you a taste of some of the tools that professional biologists use to analyze in much more detail.</p>

<p class="p7">Every human body is home to a rich environment of tiny living organisms, trillions of them, with their own genes, their own ways of living and surviving, and their own long histories, permanently intertwined with humanity since the beginning.</p>
<p class="p7">These microbes inhabit every possible niche inside and outside the body. Covering every inch of skin, lining every part of the nose and ears, they have burrowed deep inside nearly every organ, consuming as well as producing, living in such quantities that together they would weigh somewhere between three and five pounds -- about as much as the brain.</p>
<p class="p7">The word "microbe" refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. The vast majority of microbes are bacteria, though viruses and phages fit this description too, as well as archaea, the extremophile life forms that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria. A typical human will have somewhere between [n and m] individual cells -- blood, skin, neurons, other tissues -- each descended from a single germ cell, the fertilized egg that began dividing itself and multiplying after the moment of conception. By contrast, microbes had to hitch their own rides later, beginning in the womb and turning into a flood at the moment of birth and beyond. But each microbe, like each human cell, remains deeply interconnected with the fates of all the other cells, all the way to the moment of death, and even after that.</p>

<p class="p7">Before we learn how to study your own microbiome, let's review some of the science.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">All life runs on three chemical building blocks:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called <span class="s1">nucleotides</span> (DNA or RNA) and <span class="s1">amino acids</span> (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters ATGC. RNA is composed of the same molecules, except that uracile (U) is substituted for thymine.</p>
<p class="p7">Similarly, proteins are constructed with only 20 different amino acids, which can again be represented by a short three-character abbreviation.</p>
<p class="p7">The correspondence between these different proteins and combinations of DNA or RNA is referred to as the genetic code.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p7">As a programmer looking through all of this, you may immediately be inspired to write your own software version of this. After all, the remarkable consistency between all of these building blocks cries out for manipulation by computer.</p>
<p class="p7">In fact, that's exactly what bioinformaticians do, and numerous software packages have been developed to make it easy to treat these building blocks of life like ordinary computer strings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Perhaps the biggest challenge is the volume of data to be handled, which can easily be measured in gigabytes for a simple organism, but can require entire server farms in the case of some real-world biological systems. For that reason, much of bioinformatics is about optimizations to improve the speed of processing a large data set, or to simply the presentation in a way that can reveal the most biologically interesting aspects of a problem without wading in over-complexity.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">One special protein, DNA, can store information</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">The cell</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Start with the cell. All living things are composed of cells, which are tiny self-contained blocks where entropy is kept at bay for as long as possible. Everything in the universe tends over time to fall into disorganized entropy, but cells contain many tricks, honed over billions of years of evolution, to thrive.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Some organisms have a single cell, and others are multi-cell, but the key division of life is not between the number of cells but rather in the complexity of its internals. Human cells, like all multicellular life forms, are classified as <span class="s1">eukaryotes</span>, because all of our cells are made of a number of internal features, called <span class="s1">organelles,</span> of which the most prominent is the <span class="s1">nucleus</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Bacteria, by contrast, are <span class="s1">prokaryotes</span>. Their cells look much simpler under a microscope: just a cell wall bounding some free-floating objects.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Part of the definition of life is the ability to reproduce, and cells do this by dividing themselves in half in a process called <span class="s1">mitosis</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia"><b><a id="doc42"></a>A crash course in botany</b></h1>
<p class="p7">How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms?</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Since Carl Linnaeus in the 1700's, the science of taxonomy divides all life into seven major categories: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (which I was taught in sixth grade to remember by the mnemonic "King Philip Came Over for Girl Scouts").<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Bacteria make up their own kingdom. Just as the animal kingdom includes everything from humans to jellyfish to beetles, the diversity of bacterial life is enormous, a point which can't be emphasized too much. This is true at every rank in the taxonomy. Even two organisms that are the same at a lower rank, like genus, might have radically different affects on the human body, just as a member of the animal genus canis could be anything from a wolf or coyote to a Chihuahua.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">You cannot mix and match these ranks. If you know something about the number of organisms in one genus, for example, this is meaningful only in comparison to the numbers of another genus. Keep that in mind during our analysis.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia"><b><a id="doc66"></a>What are they doing?</b></h1>
<p class="p7">Toxoplasma Gondii is a tiny microbe that, for some reason, only likes to reproduce from within the gut of a cat. It can be found in almost all warm-blooded mammals, including humans -- about 30% of us, according to some estimates, and that's after a century of obsession with hygiene that has wiped out countless other tiny inhabitants of the body.</p>
<p class="p7">T. Gondii seem harmless because its hosts appear to show no differences before or after "infection" except in one creature: the mouse. When it finds itself ingested by a mouse, it appears to fade away quietly. MRI scans show large amounts in the gut for a week or two, gradually decreasing until there is apparently nothing. Except: tiny T. Gondii cysts begin to show up in the mouse's brain. Not everywhere, but in just a few strategic places.</p>
<p class="p7">Then something strange happens: the mouse is suddenly attracted to cat urine. And note: its only attraction is to <span class="s1">cat</span> urine, not rabbits, not humans -- only cats. Everything else about the mouse appears normal. It still seems to be afraid of the other things that scare mice: other predators, stressful situations. But put a T. Gondii-affected mouse into a maze with different animal urine in the corners and it will rush to the cat side every time.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">How is it that T. Gondii is able to be so precise in its effects? It only seems to affect mice, and even then it only apparently makes them attracted to cats. It doesn't apparently cause any other harm to its hosts, so -- somehow -- it must have found a resting place right at the spot in the mouse brain that affects its interest in cats.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Although there doesn't seem to be any major negative consequences to humans hosting T. Gondii, some scientists aren't sure. One man in particular, Jaroslav Flegr, an evolutionary biologist at Charles University in Prague, thinks he has evidence that women who carry it might be more trusting than those who don't.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">T.Gondii isn't the only microbe known to affect the behavior of its host. A more common example is the rabies virus, which upon infection somehow causes a mammal to be more agitated, more likely to strike out -- or bite -- other humans, thereby spreading itself.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Think about this too much, and you'll end up with the obvious question: what other weird microbes are infecting us right now? Can we explain some of our own behaviors this way? Is there a human equivalent of these infections, driving us to do things we "ordinarily" wouldn't do? And maybe these microbes are so ubiquitous, teeming all over us and in our brains, maybe there's no way to even know what "ordinary" or "normal" human behavior is.</p>

<p class="p17">During the late 1990s, biologists around the world were racing to complete the first sequence of the human genome, a first draft of which was available in June 2000, and the project was declared complete in 2003. With this sequence available, scientists now had the first rough map of all the genes that make up a human being, and they were hopeful that this would be quickly followed by new discoveries linking genes to health.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p7">Two major problems had to be solved before scientists could begin seriously studying the microbiome.</p>
<p class="p7">First, the various bacteria inside us had to be identified. Since the invention of the microscope, the process was straightforward: collect enough of the organisms of interest and then look at them, either as a whole while cultured in a lab, or individually under the microsoft.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Computer scientists have an easier time than biologists because operations are so fast you can afford to do them over and over. In biology, individual operations are much slower, but you can run them in parallel. That goop in the petri dish is often made of trillions of organisms, each one consuming, producing, and multiplying individually. Even with the very low error rates in ordinary cell division, you have so many organisms that you will regularly get a few mutations, and if the experiment is well-controlled, you will be able to see those mutations.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia"><b><a id="doc40"></a>The old way: culturing</b></h1>
<p class="p7">How do you tell which microbe is which?</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Until recently, the old fashioned way was the only way. You get some of the bacterium of interest and then grow more of it. In other words, a glorified version of farming.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">How do you farm a microbe? Basically, you put it in a petri dish along with something that it likes to eat, and you wait for it to grow. What does it like to eat? Well, that's the "art". If you find the right substance and just the right environment, it might grow. Then again, it might not. Much of this is trial and error.</p>
<p class="p7">A bigger problem with culturing is that some organisms need other organisms in order to survive. You may be simply unable to grow the one of interest unless you have a whole colony of other, unrelated but symbiont organisms nearby to provide it something it needs. In other words, it may simply be impossible to grow a bunch of one particular organism in isolation.</p>

<p class="p7">There are several ways for an individual to get access to the powerful sequencers that make 16S rRNA analysis possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">That said, just as I mentioned 23andme as a way to find information about your DNA, there are a few ways you can get information about your microbiome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One way is through a doctor, or other health care provider who can give you a clinical test, just like you might do a blood draw as part of an annual physical. If you have a medical condition, the tests are likely covered by insurance, but tend to be pretty expensive (several hundred dollars or more).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">For "normal" people, just curious about the science like I am, there are two other ways to find out your microbiome:</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The first is called American Gut Project, associated with a lab at the University of California San Diego and others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For a $100 donation, they'll send you a sampling kit which you send back to get a breakdown of your gut bacteria. American Gut boasts an impressive number of practicing research scientists, including several of the key contributors to the Human Microbiome<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p13"><img src="Images/American Gut.png" width="245" height="111" alt="Image"></p>
<p class="p7">I recommend the San Francisco company uBiome.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>History of uBiome</b></p>
<p class="p7">The company was founded in late 2012 by Jessica Richman and Zach Apte, who met while doing graduate studies at Oxford. Jessica, with an undergraduate degree from Stanford, was studying public policy, using computers to understand how new ideas go viral. Zach was a biologist studying the microbiome, disappointed at how long it took to collect the vast number of samples required to do the science. The problem, they realized, was not lack of interest from the general public. There was no shortage of people interested in the microbiome and its affect on health, many of whom would happily contribute samples if they could help the science. They suspected that many of these "citizen scientists" were so eager to help that they might even <span class="s1">pay</span> for the privilege of participating in an experiment, particularly if they could receive personalized results of their own tests.</p>
<p class="p7">In November 2012, they launched their first crowd funding campaign on the site Indiegogo, hoping to raise $100,000 to start the business. They started by selling "perks", $89 for a gut kit, $399 for a five-sample kit, offering to run the samples through the sequencing machine that Zach Apte was using at the University of California San Francisco biotech startup garage. To their surprise, the campaign raised more than $350,000, and the company was off and running.</p>
<p class="p7">Since uBiome focused from the beginning on crowd-sourced open science, their kits were designed to be as easy to use as possible. With glossy-printed, step-by-step directions and an attractive kit with well-labeled test tubes, they wanted to let ordinary people take samples and submit them with as little fuss as possible.</p>
<p class="p7">At the lab, uBiome also focused on automation. They built two special collection robots that could open the test tubes with the ultimate goal that they'd be able to submit to the sequencing machine with barely any human intervention.</p>
<p class="p13"><img src="Images/uBiomeRobot20130917001011-robot.jpg" width="504" height="503" alt="Image"></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">The strong start with the Indiegogo campaign brought them enough money to start the business, but more importantly it attracted the attention of other investors who soon contributed $1.5M to the new company. Eventually the uBiome staff signed on to the prestigious Y-Combinator, the startup incubator that has given birth to many famous names including Airbnb, Reddit, Dropbox and others, and landed an additional $3M investment from the prestigious venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p class="p7">With the new investment capital, uBiome was able to open a new headquarters and buy their own $300,000 NextSeq500 gene sequencing machine and more automation to help them process the samples more quickly.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">The most popular gene sequencer is the NextSeq500, from San Diego-based Illumina.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia"><b><a id="doc46"></a>The basics: web tools</b></h1>
<p class="p7">After uBiome has notified you of your results, you can go to <a href="http://app.ubiome.com">their web site</a> to learn more.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>

<h1 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Georgia"><b><a id="doc56"></a>Analyze with Excel</b></h1>
<p class="p7">The Illumina machines spit off huge amounts of data (FASTQ files can be hundreds of thousands of lines long), so to be useful you'll need a summary. UBiome provides a much more concise version called a "raw taxonomy" file, which is generally only a few hundred lines showing just the organisms they think they found in the sample.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>What is JSON</b></p>
<p class="p7">UBiome's taxonomy files come in a simple structured text format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), commonly used across the web. Although it's not as convenient for people as the rest of the uBiome web site, programmers refer to JSON as "human readable", because if you squint enough you can sorta tell what it means without a computer program. Here's a sample:</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p19">{</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"ubiome_bacteriacounts": [{</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"taxon": "2",</p>

<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"count_norm": "1000000",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"avg": null,</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"tax_name": "Bacteria",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"tax_rank": "superkingdom",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"tax_color": null</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}, {</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"taxon": "1239",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"parent": "2",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"count": "15414",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"count_norm": "679300",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"avg": null,</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"tax_name": "Firmicutes",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"tax_rank": "phylum",</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"tax_color": "5E6591"</p>
<p class="p19"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>}</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">JSON is just structured data. That's it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The data is organized according to <span class="s1">keys</span> and <span class="s1">values</span>. The <span class="s1">keys</span> are unique identifiers and the values are their values. The whole file looks that way. The only requirement of a JSON file is that it be consistent with this pattern, because after all it will need to be read by a computer eventually.</p>
<p class="p7">The uBiome Taxonomy JSON files identify the key ```uBiome_bacteriacounts``` which is mapped to a bunch of fields, each representing a particular organism found in your sample. Look at the figure above to get the basic idea.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Because uBiome JSON files are well-structured, it's easy to process them with other software, including Excel. That's our next step: bring this data into Excel.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>Converting uBiome taxonomy JSON to Excel</b></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">If you just have one or two files, it's easy to bring uBiome taxonomy data into Excel. Go to the uBiome apps page and click on the section labeled "Download taxonomy".</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p13"><img src="Images/uBiomeScreenDownloadData.png" width="290" height="325" alt="Image"></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">You'll see a page of JSON representing what uBiome found in your sample.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p13"><img src="Images/uBiomeScreenShotTaxonomyJSON.png" width="471" height="225" alt="Image"></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">On a desktop computer, if you select-all (press control-A or command-A) then you can copy this data to the clipboard to prepare to paste it to another web site.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">There are many web sites that will convert JSON to a format that will work in Excel. Google "Json to Excel" or "Json to CSV" and you'll find one. Just paste your data into one of those sites to convert it for either Excel's native (XLS or XLSX) format, or the more universal CSV format, readable by Excel. Here are a few of the sites I've tested:</p>
<p class="p7"><a href="http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm">http://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm</a></p>
<p class="p7"><a href="http://www.json-xls.com/json2xls">http://www.json-xls.com/json2xls</a></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Once the data is in Excel, you can work with it just as you would with any Excel data sheet. Here's how one of my recent uBiome taxonomy files looks in Mac Excel:</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p13"><img src="Images/ExcelScreenOverview.png" width="505" height="311" alt="Image"></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Yours may look slightly different. Sometimes uBiome changes the labels on the taxonomy slightly, and the ordering of the columns may be different depending on how the JSON was converted, but none of that matters. The key is that you are now able to work with it in a full-blown spreadsheet.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>The uBiome data tags</b></p>
<p class="p7">Let's review the meaning of each of the columns. The uBiome JSON taxonomy data includes the following fields:</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">The uBiome JSON taxonomy data includes the following fields:</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>count</b>: an absolute measure of number of organisms found in the sample. Without knowing the size of the sample, or how many times the DNA inside was processed through PCR amplification, this number doesn't mean much except in relation to other counts at the same taxonomical rank.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>count_norm:</b> a "normalized" version of the count, created by simply dividing the count on a given row by the count found on the row with tax_name = Bacteria and then multiplying by one million. It's easier to just think of it as parts per million: each unit is 1 / 10,000th of a percent. For example, if you see a row with count_norm = 500,000, you can just think of that as 50% of the sample.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>tax_name</b>: this is the classification of the organism based on the level of its taxonomy. If you were looking at a human being, for example, you would see homo sapiens if you selected tax_rank = species, but you'd see mammalia if you selected tax_rank = class.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>tax_rank</b>: tells the level of the taxonomy. In daily conversation about animals or plants, we usually refer to the species (e.g. homo sapiens), but sometimes it's more useful to talk about bigger groupings of related organisms. For example, humans are members of the class mammalia, along with tigers and horses. If this spreadsheet were counting organisms at the level of class mammalia, the count_norm would almost certainly be bigger than the count_norm for humans alone, unless humans were the only type of mammal found in the sample. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>taxon and parent:</b> these help identify the ranking in a more precise way by pointing out which tax_ranks are subsets of which. For example, Bacteroidia above has a parent = 976, meaning that it is a subset of the taxon 976, Bacteroidetes. When you follow the various taxons and parents up the chain, you'll see they all end in the superkingdom Bacteria, which has a taxon of 2. The values for these numbers, incidentally, are taxonomical numbers from the curated database at NCBI, the national bioinformatics center run by the U.S. government. Enter the number into the taxonomy browser at the NCBI Taxonomy Browser and you can learn as much as you want about that organism.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>tax_color </b>doesn't matter for this anaysis, but uBiome software uses this to colorize their pretty graphs to make them more readable.</p>

<p class="p7">Once you've developed an appreciation for the importance of the microbiome, you'll want to become more of a farmer, growing your own symbionts.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">People have been fermenting food since the distant past, making everything from beer to cheese. Fermentation is an ideal way to preserve food beyond the date at which it is practical to eat.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7">Fermenting your own foods is surprisingly easy.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>Yogurt</b></p>
<p class="p7">One of the easiest ferments is home-made yogurt. Pour a few cups of whole milk into a saucepan and heat to not-quite-boiling. You'll need to get it above 160 degrees, the temperature that kills bacteria in milk, but if it goes all the way to boiling the milk will taste scalded. Even that's not the end of the world, but you may as well try to keep it under that. Use a kitchen thermometer the first few times if you like, but soon you'll be able to tell intuitively because you'll see steam rising from the surface of the milk, but no boiling bubbles.</p>
<p class="p7">After the milk has been heated, remove and pour it into a glass bowl. Let it sit until it cools to about 110 degrees. Here, a kitchen thermometer is more useful, especially the first time because the exact temperature is more important. Warmer than 110 degrees and the <span class="s1">lactobacillus</span> yogurt bacteria will die; too much lower and they won't grow. Once you have the hang of it, you'll be able to tell based on the touch: it'll feel unpleasantly warmer than your hand (which should be 98 degrees) but not too warm to touch.</p>
<p class="p7">Once the milk hits that rough temperature zone, pour in a tiny amount of yogurt from another source.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is called the "starter" yogurt and the best is to use a bit of leftover from your previous batch, but for your first attempt you can use any commercially-purchased yogurt. Sweetened, flavored, non-fat -- any kind is okay as long as it has live cultures in it.</p>
<p class="p7">Be sure not to use too much yogurt. Definitely no more than a tablespoon, and perhaps even just a teaspoon or two. Because of the small amounts, you'll be tempted to think you need more, but in this case more is definitely not better. Too much starter will suffocate the mixture. Whenever I've had an unsuccessful batch it's almost always due to having too much starter.</p>
<p class="p7">Mix the starter thoroughly into the lukewarm milk and then cover it up and put it someplace warm. The key is to keep the mixture close to that magical 110 degree point. Some people put it overnight in an oven set to the lowest temperature, but if you don't like running the oven overnight you can try wrapping it tightly with something that will retain the heat through the night. If have a high-quality thermos-style cooler, you can set it inside there, and some people cover it with thick towels and set it in the warmest part of the house. Another option is to use a heating pad, set to the lowest setting and placed underneath the bowl. The important thing is to keep the mixture at the warm temperatures that the bacteria need in order to breed.</p>
<p class="p7">Set in a quiet place for about 8-10 hours. Overnight is ideal. When you open the bowl again, you'll find the mixture no longer resembles milk, but has been transformed into a much thicker consistency -- a yogurt. It will taste sour, and if you're not accustomed to plain, unsweetened yogurt you may even think that is has spoiled. Nope, that's just how pure, real yogurt is meant to taste.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>Pickling</b></p>
<p class="p7">The next step after yogurt-making is also easy. It takes a little longer, from one to several weeks, but lets you expand your fermentation skills to many more foods. The most basic one is cabbage, to make your own sauerkraut.</p>
<p class="p7">Think of fermentation as a type of farming, only instead of large plants that you see, you're farming with invisible microbes. In both cases the object is to start with a small seed that grows into a full crop. For sauerkraut, the microbes are naturally occurring on the leaves of plants and vegetables. You just need to put them into the right environment so the microbes can grow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7">Start with a small head of cabbage and a grater. If you don't have a grater, then just chop it into small pieces. Cabbage is already covered with tiny microbes, but the interesting ones will not reproduce in the presence of oxygen; you need to get them out of the air. The best way to do that is to submerge them in a liquid -- in this case we'll use the naturally occurring water inside the cabbage leaves themselves. The purpose of grating or chopping is simply to let the water escape from the leaves until it covers the entire mixture.</p>
<p class="p7">You'll need some type of container to submerge the leaves. Best is something made of glass or ceramic, though any container is fine as long as it doesn't react with the acids that will be produced by the microbes. A standard mason jar works, for example, or even a cleaned-out jar of pasta sauce. Make sure you have a lid for the container, and make sure the lid doesn't close too tightly. If you use something with a screw-top lid (like a pasta sauce jar) just pop a few tiny holes in the lid. The microbes will be producing carbon dioxide as they ferment, and you'll need a way for the gases to leave or the container will explode.</p>
<p class="p7">Begin packing the cabbage leaves into the container as tightly as possible. While doing this, most people add some salt. The salt serves two purposes; it adds flavor, and it helps draw more water out of the plant. Just a small amount of salt is enough: about what you would use if you were seasoning it for flavor: a few shakes on each cabbage leaf as you peel it is enough, or maybe a total of a tablespoon or two for a small head of cabbage. Continue to pile more leaves into the container until it is full.</p>
<p class="p7">If you're doing everything correctly, there will be a nice layer of liquid that completely covers the leaves in the container. Remember that the microbes can't reproduce if there is air, so covering with liquid is essential. If you see any green leaves poking out of the liquid, pack them down further. It may help to find an insert of some kind to place directly over the leaves, perhaps anthe lid to a smaller sized jar, one that fits inside the container and lets you squish the leaves even tighter. The key is to keep everything submerged in liquid.</p>
<p class="p7">Put as many cabbage leaves as you can into the container and close the lid, but be careful: the bacteria in the jar will soon start to produce carbon dioxide gas, which will put pressure on the container. That's the reason for the air holes you poked in the lid beforehand. You may want to cover the entire jar with a loose-fitting piece of cellophane, or an old cloth, as a precaution in case the aroma begins to attract insects.</p>
<p class="p7">That's it! Leave the fermenting jar in a cool, undisturbed place and then check on it for the first few days. Make sure the liquid has entirely submerged the cabbage leaves. Within a day or two you'll also notice some air bubbles in the liquid -- the sign that the fermentation has begun to work. Now, just let the jar rest for another several days or more. The longer it sits, the more acidic it will become. If you like a sour taste, let it sit for a week or two, maybe even up to a month or more. If you want a more subtle flavor, take it out in a few days. Feel free to sniff the jar every day or two to decide when you think it's ready.</p>
<p class="p7">When finished, it will look and smell like sauerkraut. If some of the leaves were not entirely submerged in liquid, it's possible that a layer of moldy fungus has appeared, unsightly but not a problem. Just scrape off whatever doesn't look like sauerkraut and eat the rest.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p7"><b>What's happening in sauerkraut</b></p>
<p class="p7">The transformation from cabbage leaves to sauerkraut happens thanks to a complex interaction of bacteria starting with some members of the Leuconostoc species that occur naturally on the cabbage leaves. These are anaerobic organisms -- they can't live in oxygen. When submerged in the cabbage liquid, however, they thrive, consuming all the sugars they can find and converting them to lactic acid, giving off carbon dioxide as a byproduct. You'll know the reaction is occurring when you spot tiny bubbles at the surface of the liquid a few hours after beginning the reaction.</p>
<p class="p7">Sadly for the Leuconostoc, they are too good at what they do. Eventually they'll consume all of the sugars they find transforming the liquid into a sour concoction, and as result the environment turns too acidic for them and they die.</p>
<p class="p7">By then, the conditions have become ideal for another species, <span class="s1">lactobacillus</span>, which was pretty much designed for acidic liquids, and they finish off the remaining sugars, until the acidic level reaches PH=3, at which point their work is done.</p>
<p class="p7">Fortunately for humans, the pathogens that could cause us harm are unable to survive in this high-acidic environment, and would be out-competed by the existing microbes anyway, so the final mixture is perfectly healthy.</p>

<p class="p7"><b>More fermentation</b></p>
<p class="p7">Just about any food can be fermented, as people in all cultures have known since pre-history. Many common ethnic foods, such as miso (soybean) or kimchee (cabbage), are possible only thanks to fermentation. When you eat "cured" bacon or sausage, you are eating something that resulted from a complex interaction between microbes and meat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
