<p class="binderItem"><strong>Foreword</strong><br/>This book is for curious people with little or no knowledge of biology, but who have a reasonable level of comfort with computer software, either as programmer, or as an end-user comfortable with the basics of installing and running common applications (Excel).<br/>
<br/>
The book is divided into four main sections:<br/>
<br/>
1. The Science: an introduction to the field of the microbiome. What makes it so interesting? How do scientists go about studying it? How much is known today and what is likely to be discover...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Intro</strong><br/>I’m a software guy, and when I think about what it means to be human, I think first of course of all the various “software” we are made of: our language, culture, education, behaviors — all things that seem to us to be flexible, even arbitrary, but which define us as individuals. But as with computers, the software can only run as well as the hardware, so I’m interested in that too: what is the CPU, the memory, the graphics card? and how can you expand or make it better and faster? What should y...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Microbes everywhere!</strong><br/>Every human body is home to a rich environment of tiny living organisms, trillions of them, with their own genes, their own ways of living and surviving, and their own long histories, permanently intertwined with humanity since the beginning. These microbes inhabit every possible niche inside and outside the body. Covering every inch of skin, lining every part of the nose and ears, they have burrowed deep inside nearly every organ, consuming as well as producing, living in such quantities that t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A crash course in microbiology</strong><br/>Before we learn how to study your own microbiome, let’s review some of the science.<br/>
<br/>
All life runs on three chemical building blocks:  DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called nucleotides (DNA or RNA) and amino acids (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters ATGC. RNA is compo...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A crash course in botany</strong><br/>How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms?<br/>
<br/>
A taxon is a simple unit of life. A homo sapiens is a taxon, but so is a primate. A mammal is a taxon too. It might seem odd in the ordinary biological world to bother using the same term ‘taxon’ to refer to all of those units, but for bacteria and anything that reproduces asexually, it’s an important distinction because often, taxonomists don’t agree about whether a group of organisms is part of the same taxon or not...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>What are they doing?</strong><br/>Toxoplasma Gondii is a tiny microbe that, for some reason, only likes to reproduce from within the gut of a cat. It can be found in almost all warm-blooded mammals, including humans — about 30% of us, according to some estimates, and that’s after a century of obsession with hygiene that has wiped out countless other tiny inhabitants of the body.<br/>
T. Gondii seem harmless because its hosts appear to show no differences before or after “infection” except in one creature: the mouse. When it finds its...</p>

<br/>
During the late 1990s, biologists around the world were racing to complete the first sequence of the human genome, a first draft of which was available in June 2000, and the project was declared complete in 2003. With this sequence available, scientists now had the first rough map of all the genes that make up a human being, and they were hopeful that this would be quickly followed by new discoveries linking genes to health. <br/>
<br/>
The Human Microbiome Project was launc...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Studying the Microbiome</strong><br/>Two major problems had to be solved before scientists could begin seriously studying the microbiome.<br/>
First, the various bacteria inside us had to be identified. Since the invention of the microscope, the process was straightforward: collect enough of the organisms of interest and then look at them, either as a whole while cultured in a lab, or individually under the microsoft.<br/>
<br/>
Computer scientists have an easier time than biologists because operations are so fast you can afford to do them over a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The old way: culturing</strong><br/>How do you tell which microbe is which?<br/>
<br/>
Until recently, the old fashioned way was the only way. You get some of the bacterium of interest and then grow more of it. In other words, a glorified version of farming.<br/>
<br/>
How do you farm a microbe? Basically, you put it in a petri dish along with something that it likes to eat, and you wait for it to grow. What does it like to eat? Well, that’s the “art”. If you find the right substance and just the right environment, it might grow. Then again, it might...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>How to get your data</strong><br/>There are several ways for an individual to get access to the powerful sequencers that make 16S rRNA analysis possible. <br/>
<br/>
That said, just as I mentioned 23andme as a way to find information about your DNA, there are a few ways you can get information about your microbiome.  One way is through a doctor, or other health care provider who can give you a clinical test, just like you might do a blood draw as part of an annual physical. If you have a medical condition, the tests are likely covered by ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The basics: web tools</strong><br/>After uBiome has notified you of your results, you can go to their web site to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing you’ll notice is a pretty chart like this one:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This shows the overall breakdown of the bacteria they found in your gut. In this chart, the bacteria are lumped by phyla —the highest, broadest level of classification. If you’re like most Americans, the vast majority of your sample will be one of two phyla: bacteroidetes or firmicutes. <br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Analyze with Excel</strong><br/>The Illumina machines spit off huge amounts of data (FASTQ files can be hundreds of thousands of lines long), so to be useful you’ll need a summary. UBiome provides a much more concise version called a “raw taxonomy” file, which is generally only a few hundred lines showing just the organisms they think they found in the sample.<br/>
<br/>
What is JSON<br/>
UBiome’s taxonomy files come in a simple structured text format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), commonly used across the web. Although it’s not a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Comparing samples</strong><br/>The uBiome JSON taxonomy file is extremely helpful at giving you a short summary of what you care about most in a sample: the organisms within it and their relative amounts. But even with these annotations, there’s a limit to what you can learn in a single sample. To be able to start hacking your microbiome, you will need to learn how to compare multiple samples.<br/>
There are two main things you’ll want to measure when comparing two samples:<br/>
<br/>

Uniqueness: which organisms are found in only one sampl...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Good and Bad</strong><br/>As tempting as it is to categorize bacteria into groups like “good” and “bad”, you should avoid that mistake. Very few organisms are always and everywhere either beneficial or harmful. Everything depends on the circumstances.<br/>
For example, from [Blaser p119]<br/>
<br/>
"viridans" streptococci  "live peacefully in everyone's mouth...a leading cause of heart valve infections...normal residents of the mouth, only occasionally entering the bloodstream and landing on a previously damaged valve....if we mix harm...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Fermented food</strong><br/>Once you’ve developed an appreciation for the importance of the microbiome, you’ll want to become more of a farmer, growing your own symbionts.<br/>
<br/>
People have been fermenting food since the distant past, making everything from beer to cheese. Fermentation is an ideal way to preserve food beyond the date at which it is practical to eat.<br/>
<br/>
Fermenting your own foods is surprisingly easy.<br/>
<br/>
Yogurt<br/>
One of the easiest ferments is home-made yogurt. Pour a few cups of whole milk into a saucepan and heat to ...</p>
