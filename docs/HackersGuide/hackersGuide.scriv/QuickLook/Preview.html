<p class="binderItem"><strong>Foreword</strong><br/>This book is for curious people with little or no knowledge of biology, but who have a reasonable level of comfort with computer software, either as programmer, or as an end-user comfortable with the basics of installing and running common applications (Excel).<br/>
<br/>
The book is divided into four main sections:<br/>
<br/>
1. The Science: an introduction to the field of the microbiome. What makes it so interesting? How do scientists go about studying it? How much is known today and what is likely to be discover...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Microbes everywhere!</strong><br/>Every human body is home to a rich environment of tiny living organisms, trillions of them, with their own genes, their own ways of living and surviving, and their own long histories, permanently intertwined with humanity since the beginning.<br/>
These microbes inhabit every possible niche inside and outside the body. Covering every inch of skin, lining every part of the nose and ears, they have burrowed deep inside nearly every organ, consuming as well as producing, living in such quantities that t...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Underground</strong><br/>Three kilometers underground, in a South African gold mine, scientists discovered [microbe that lives on dirt]<br/>

There are even microbes that thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A crash course in microbiology</strong><br/>All life runs on three chemical building blocks:  DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called nucleotides (DNA or RNA) and amino acids (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters ATGC. RNA is composed of the same molecules, except that uracile (U) is substituted for thymine.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A crash course in botany</strong><br/>How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms?<br/>
<br/>
Since Carl Linnaeus in the 1700’s, the science of taxonomy divides all life into seven major categories: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species (which I was taught in sixth grade to remember by the mnemonic “King Philip Came Over for Girl Scouts”). <br/>
<br/>
Bacteria make up their own kingdom. Just as the animal kingdom includes everything from humans to jellyfish to beetles, the diversity of bacterial life is ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Studying the Microbiome</strong><br/>Two major problems had to be solved before scientists could begin seriously studying the microbiome.<br/>
First, the various bacteria inside us had to be identified. Since the invention of the microscope, the process was straightforward: collect enough of the organisms of interest and then look at them, either as a whole while cultured in a lab, or individually under the microsoft.<br/>
<br/>
Computer scientists have an easier time than biologists because operations are so fast you can afford to do them over a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The old way: culturing</strong><br/>How do you tell which microbe is which?<br/>
<br/>
Until recently, the old fashioned way was the only way. You get some of the bacterium of interest and then grow more of it. In other words, a glorified version of farming.<br/>
<br/>
How do you farm a microbe? Basically, you put it in a petri dish along with something that it likes to eat, and you wait for it to grow. What does it like to eat? Well, that’s the “art”. If you find the right substance and just the right environment, it might grow. Then again, it might...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>How to get your data</strong><br/>There are several ways for an individual to get access to the powerful sequencers that make 16S rRNA analysis possible. <br/>
I recommend the San Francisco company uBiome.<br/>
<br/>
The most popular gene sequencer is the NextSeq500, from San Diego-based Illumina.<br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The basics: web tools</strong><br/>After uBiome has notified you of your results, you can go to their web site to learn more.<br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Analyze with Excel</strong><br/>The Illumina machines spit off huge amounts of data (FASTQ files can be hundreds of thousands of lines long), so to be useful you’ll need a summary. UBiome provides a much more concise version called a “raw taxonomy” file, which is generally only a few hundred lines showing just the organisms they think they found in the sample.<br/>
<br/>
What is JSON<br/>
UBiome’s taxonomy files come in a simple structured text format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), commonly used across the web. Although it’s not a...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Good and Bad</strong><br/>As tempting as it is to categorize bacteria into groups like “good” and “bad”, you should avoid that mistake. Very few organisms are always and everywhere either beneficial or harmful. Everything depends on the circumstances.<br/>
For example, from [Blaser p119]<br/>
<br/>
"viridans" streptococci  "live peacefully in everyone's mouth...a leading cause of heart valve infections...normal residents of the mouth, only occasionally entering the bloodstream and landing on a previously damaged valve....if we mix harm...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Fermented food</strong><br/>Once you’ve developed an appreciation for the importance of the microbiome, you’ll want to become more of a farmer, growing your own symbionts.<br/>
<br/>
People have been fermenting food since the distant past, making everything from beer to cheese. Fermentation is an ideal way to preserve food beyond the date at which it is practical to eat.<br/>
