<p class="binderItem"><strong>Foreword</strong><br/>This book is for curious people with little or no knowledge of biology who want to learn the basics of the human microbiome in a hands-on, practical way — by experimenting on yourself. We assume you have a reasonable level of comfort with computer software, either as programmer, or as an end-user comfortable installing and running common applications like Excel.  By practicing with your own examples, you’ll learn how to study and manipulate the microbes inside you.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Intro</strong><br/>In the age-old argument about nurture vs. nature, most of the scientific conclusions over the past half-century point to a resounding victory for nature. From twin studies to gene sequencing, nearly any rigorous scientific attempt to compare the role of genes with the environment show the powerful role that DNA plays in everything from illness to physical aptitude to intelligence and even behavior. The inescapable conclusion seems to be that yes, genes are destiny.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Microbes everywhere!</strong><br/>The word “microbe” refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Far too small to see with the naked eye, dozens could fit inside a typical human cell. The vast majority of microbes are bacteria, though viruses and phages fit this description too, as well as archaea, the extremophile life forms that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria.<br/>
Because they’re so small, we normally don’t think much about microbes, but the...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Microbes</strong><br/>Scientists have known since Pasteur times that our bodies and environment are awash in other species, microbial bystanders that seem to grow everywhere. But the techniques for uncovering which organisms are where and what they are doing was revolutionized in the first decade of the 2000s by those new-fangled gene sequencers that were so usefully applied to human genes.<br/>
The old technique for studying the microbial life around us required taking a sample, inserting it into a culture of some nutrie...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Microbes in your body</strong><br/>A gene is an instruction for making a protein. There are roughly 30,000 genes in your body, so there should be at least 30,000 proteins floating about, though actually it’s much more complicated. The gene represents the instructions, but which proteins are expressed depends on a complex interaction among the rest of your DNA and its environment. The science of  figuring it all out is called proteomics, and it’s difficult to say exactly how many proteins are produced in your body.<br/>
One reason it’s...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Microbes in the gut</strong><br/>Every human body is home to a rich environment of tiny living organisms, trillions of them, with their own genes, their own ways of living and surviving, and their own long histories, permanently intertwined with humanity since the beginning. These microbes inhabit every possible niche inside and outside the body. Covering every inch of skin, lining every part of the nose and ears, they have burrowed deep inside nearly every organ, consuming as well as producing, living in such quantities that t...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Microbes of the skin</strong><br/>Microbes of the gut are important, but many other organisms are crawling all over you too.<br/>
It should be no surprise that the most obvious place for them to live is on your outside: your skin and hair. We usually think of bacteria, fungi, or viruses, as something to eradicate, pests that can only be there to cause problems. The natural state of the body is pristinely washed: clean, with no dirt or other blemishes.<br/>
This pristine state has never been true. Humans, like all other multi-celled creatu...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>What are they doing?</strong><br/>We don’t normally pay much attention to the role that microbes play in our daily lives, other than as an annoyance that occasionally makes us sick. But the more that scientists uncover, the more it becomes clear that something this old and ubiquitous is not nearly as hands-off as we think.<br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Studying the Human Microbiome</strong><br/>During the late 1990s, biologists around the world were racing to complete the first sequence of the human genome, a first draft of which was available in June 2000, and the project was declared complete in 2003. With this sequence available, scientists now had the first rough map of all the genes that make up a human being, and they were hopeful that this would be quickly followed by new discoveries linking genes to health. <br/>
<br/>
The Human Microbiome Project was launched in 2008 by the National Ins...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>A crash course in microbiology</strong><br/>Before we learn how to study your own microbiome, let’s review some of the science.<br/>
<br/>
All life runs on three chemical building blocks:  DNA, RNA, and proteins. Each of these is an arbitrarily-long chain of repeating molecules called nucleotides (DNA or RNA) and amino acids (proteins). Due to constraints on the way atoms interact, the set of building blocks is fixed. All DNA is composed of only four nucleotides: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine, represented by the letters ATGC. RNA is compo...</p>

<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>A crash course in botany</strong><br/>How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms?<br/>
<br/>
A taxon is a simple unit of life. A homo sapiens is a taxon, but so is a primate. A mammal is a taxon too. It might seem odd in the ordinary biological world to bother using the same term ‘taxon’ to refer to all of those units, but for bacteria and anything that reproduces asexually, it’s an important distinction because often, taxonomists don’t agree about whether a group of organisms is part of the same taxon or not...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Studying the Microbiome</strong><br/>Two major problems had to be solved before scientists could begin seriously studying the microbiome.<br/>
First, the various bacteria inside us had to be identified. Since the invention of the microscope, the process was straightforward: collect enough of the organisms of interest and then look at them, either as a whole while cultured in a lab, or individually under the microsoft.<br/>
<br/>
Computer scientists have an easier time than biologists because operations are so fast you can afford to do them over a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>The old way: culturing</strong><br/>How do you tell which microbe is which?<br/>
<br/>
Until recently, the old fashioned way was the only way. You get some of the bacterium of interest and then grow more of it. In other words, a glorified version of farming.<br/>
<br/>
How do you farm a microbe? Basically, you put it in a petri dish along with something that it likes to eat, and you wait for it to grow. What does it like to eat? Well, that’s the “art”. If you find the right substance and just the right environment, it might grow. Then again, it might...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>16s rRNA</strong><br/>The 16S shortcut<br/>
<br/>
A living organism can contain somewhere between thousands and hundreds of billions of DNA base pairs. There is some commonality between related organisms — humans and chimpanzees, for example, share upwards of 90% of their DNA — but in general it’s hard to use the DNA strand itself to measure the relatedness between two organisms. Understanding the reason for this may help you understand why there is a clever shortcut.<br/>
You might think you can measure the relatedness of two orga...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>How to get your data</strong><br/>There are several ways for an individual to get access to the powerful sequencers that make 16S rRNA analysis possible. <br/>
One way is through a doctor, or other health care provider who can give you a clinical test, just like you might do a blood draw as part of an annual physical. If you have a medical condition, the tests are likely covered by insurance, but tend to be pretty expensive (several hundred dollars or more). Genova Diagnostics is the market leader, and will give your doctor a report ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The basics: web tools</strong><br/>After uBiome has notified you of your results, you can go to their web site to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing you’ll notice is a pretty chart like this one:<br/>
#<br/>
<br/>
This shows the overall breakdown of the bacteria they found in your gut. In this chart, the bacteria are lumped by phyla —the highest, broadest level of classification. If you’re like most Americans, the vast majority of your sample will be one of two phyla: bacteroidetes or firmicutes. <br/>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Analyze with Excel</strong><br/>The Illumina machines spit off huge amounts of data (FASTQ files can be hundreds of thousands of lines long), so to be useful you’ll need a summary. UBiome provides a much more concise version called a “raw taxonomy” file, which is generally only a few hundred lines showing just the organisms they think they found in the sample.<br/>
<br/>
What is JSON<br/>
UBiome’s taxonomy files come in a simple structured text format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), commonly used across the web. Although it’s not a...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="binderItem"><strong>Comparing samples</strong><br/>The uBiome JSON taxonomy file is extremely helpful at giving you a short summary of what you care about most in a sample: the organisms within it and their relative amounts. But even with these annotations, there’s a limit to what you can learn in a single sample. To be able to start hacking your microbiome, you will need to learn how to compare multiple samples.<br/>
There are two main things you’ll want to measure when comparing two samples:<br/>

I often read news about a fresh scientific discovery involving the microbiome and immediately wonder if the discovery applies to me. For example, I recently saw a study from Oregon State University that seemed to find a link between high sugar diets and “cognitive flexibility”, i.e. your ability to adapt and adjust to changing circumstances. The study’s author, Kathy Magnusson, a professor in the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine, found that mice who eat ...</p>

While there are few agreed-upon standards for what constitutes a good or bad microbiome, nearly everyone agrees that a diverse microbiome is better than one that is less diverse. How can we measure diversity?<br/>

The first question most people ask about a specific bacterium is “is it good or bad?”.<br/>
As tempting as it is to categorize bacteria into groups like “good” and “bad”, you should avoid that mistake. Very few organisms are always and everywhere either beneficial or harmful. Everything depends on the circumstances.<br/>

<br/>
About a year ago, I started to notice my sleep becoming less regular. Nothing serious — thankfully, I’ve never had sleep problems — but I was waking up too early, and I didn’t seem to be quite as refreshed. Maybe it’s just a sign of age, I thought, until I read in Martin Blaser’s excellent book Missing Microbes (p.304) that most (80%) of the precursors to the sleep- and mood-regulating neurotransmitter serotonin is made in the gut.
