# Foreword #

The world of the small is very small indeed.

# Chapter One: The Science #

## Microbes everywhere! ##

Every human body is home to a rich environment of tiny living organisms, trillions of them, with their own genes, their own ways of living and surviving, and their own long histories, permanently intertwined with humanity since the beginning.

These microbes inhabit every possible niche inside and outside the body. Covering every inch of skin, lining every part of the nose and ears, they have burrowed deep inside nearly every organ, consuming as well as producing, living in such quantities that together they would weigh somewhere between three and five pounds --- about as much as the brain.

The word "microbe" refers to any tiny organism that carries its own genetic information for purposes of propagating itself. Much smaller even than the cells that make up our body, the vast majority of microbes are bacteria, though viruses and phages fit this description too, as well as archaea, the extremophile life forms that live and thrive in environments too challenging for bacteria. A typical human will have somewhere between [n and m] individual cells --- blood, skin, neurons, other tissues --- each descended from a single germ cell, the fertilized egg that began dividing itself and multiplying after the moment of conception. By contrast, microbes had to hitch their own rides later, beginning in the womb and turning into a flood at the moment of birth and beyond. But each microbe, like each human cell, remains deeply interconnected with the fates of all the other cells, all the way to the moment of death, and even after that.




### In the air ###

A team in France, performing experiments on snowflakes, discovered microbes in the sky.

### Underground ###

Three kilometers underground, in a South African gold mine, scientists discovered [microbe that lives on dirt]

There are even microbes that thrive in radioactive environments, like the dangerous interior of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor.

## A crash course in microbiology ##

Start with the cell. All living things are composed of cells.



## A crash course in botany ##

How do you talk about the relationships between various different life forms?

# Chapter Two: The Technology #

## The old way: culturing ##

How do you tell which microbe is which?

Until recently, the old fashioned way was the only way. You get some of the bacterium of interest and then grow more of it. In other words, a glorified version of farming.

## 16s rRNA ##

The 16S shortcut



## Gene sequencing ##

Gene sequencing


## Bioinformatics ##

Once you have the data computerized, the analysis tools leave the wet world of biology and enter the clean world of computing. This marriage is called bioinformatics.

# Chapter Three: How to Analyze Your Microbiome #

## How to get your data ##

There are several ways for an individual to get access to the powerful sequencers that make 16S rRNA analysis possible. 
I recommend the San Francisco company uBiome.

The most popular gene sequencer is the NextSeq500, from San Diego-based Illumina.



## The basics: web tools ##

After uBiome has notified you of your results, you can go to their web site to learn more.



## Analyze with Excel ##

# Chapter Four: Organisms to Watch #

## Good and Bad ##

As tempting as it is to categorize bacteria into groups like "good" and "bad", you should avoid that mistake. Very few organisms are always and everywhere either beneficial or harmful. Everything depends on the circumstances.
For example, from [Blaser p119]

"viridans" streptococci  "live peacefully in everyone's mouth...a leading cause of heart valve infections...normal residents of the mouth, only occasionally entering the bloodstream and landing on a previously damaged valve....if we mix harmless Viridans with pathogenic Group A strep, viridans always win out. They knock back the strep."

# Chapter Five: Next Steps #

## Fermented food ##

Once you've developed an appreciation for the importance of the microbiome, you'll want to become more of a farmer, growing your own symbionts.

People have been fermenting food since the distant past, making everything from beer to cheese. Fermentation is an ideal way to preserve food beyond the date at which it is practical to eat.
