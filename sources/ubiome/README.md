Using the Ubiome Python Library
---

[uBiome](http://ubiome.com) is a citizen science company that collects and analyzes samples of the human microbiome. Send your sample and get it processed using the information contained in the 16S ribosomal subregion of the bacterial genome.

Advanced users have access to the raw data, including the original FASTQ files from uBiome's Illumina NextSeq500 machine as well as a JSON-encapsulated summary of the results.

This library will help you analyze and process the JSON summary.

Until we have complete documentation, please see the [ubiome-example](microbiome-tools/ubiome_example.py) to see how this works.

## Get Started Quickly

If you already have your uBiome results downloaded and you know how to use a command line interface on your computer (either Terminal on a Mac or Powershell on Windows), type

    $ pip install ubiome

  to download the uBiome Python library from the Python Package Index.

  If you already have two uBiome JSON files available in your current directory, like this:

    $ ls

    sample1.json  sample2.json  x.csv

Run the following series of commands in your Python 2+ or 3+ console:

    $ python

    >>> from ubiome import *
    >>> x1 = UbiomeSample("sample1.json")
    >>> x2 = UbiomeSample("sample2.json")
    >>> x = UbiomeMultiSample(x1)
    >>> x.merge(x2)
    >>> x.write("x.csv")

Now your directory will have a new file ```x.csv``` with both samples merged.

###Class uBiomeSample


    class UbiomeSample
         |  class representation of a well-formed uBiome sample
         |
         |  Methods defined here:
         |
         |  __init__(self, fname='', name='', date=datetime.date(2000, 1, 1), site='gut')
         |      initialize with a string representing the path to a uBiome-formatted JSON file
         |      If no name, just instantiate an object; you can read the contents later using self.load()
         |      :param fname : filename
         |      :param name: name for the sample
         |      :type name: str

         |
         |  addCountsToList(self, taxonList)
         |      given a list of taxa, return another list, of dicts, that contain the same taxa and their corresponding count_norm
         |      :param taxonList: list # contains taxnames
         |      :return:
         |
         |  compareWith(self, sample2)
         |      compare the current sample with sample2 and return a uBiomeDiffSample object of the differences
         |
         |      :param sample2: UbiomeSample
         |      :type sample2: UbiomeSample
         |      :return: UBiomeDiffSample
         |      :rtype: UbiomeDiffSample
         |
         |  countNormOf(self, taxName)
         |      returns the count_norm of a given taxName for a sample
         |      :param taxName: string representation of a uBiome tax_name
         |      :return:
         |
         |  diversity(self, rank='family')
         |      uses Simpson index: http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/53455/simpson-diversity-index
         |
         |      :param rank: specify the rank that will be used for the calculations. uBiome generally measures at the Family level.
         |      :return float representing the inverse simpson diversity found in the sample.
         |      :rtype float
         |
         |  load(self, fname, ftype='JSON')
         |      read a JSON file of the uBiome taxonomy (the one you get from downloading from the uBiome web site)
         |      :type fname: str
         |      :param fname: the string filename containing JSON data
         |      :param ftype: currently unused, but provided for future compatibility

         |  prettyPrint(self)

         |
         |  sort(self, sortBy='tax_name')
